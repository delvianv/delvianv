## About me

**I specialise in building beautiful cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, macOS, 
and Linux using Python and Qt because we still need desktop apps for some tasks and 
most developers seem to be building web or mobile apps. Desktop apps are also more 
reliable and secure because they run on your computer, so you donâ€™t need to rely on 
Internet access to use them and your data stays private. But I also have experience in 
building web and mobile apps for iOS and Android using Django and JavaScript with React 
and React Native.**

**My work experience for the past 18 years is a combination of hardware and software 
roles. Highlights in my career include maintaining communication equipment for the SA 
Air Force, programming building automation systems, and building apps for a financial 
service company.**

I learned my first programming language, BASIC, in 1998 when I was 12 years old by 
borrowing books from my local library. That was before we had the Internet as we know 
it today. I learned my second and third languages, Pascal and Java, in 2001 when my 
high school started teaching programming. I also learned **Python** and **JavaScript** 
around that time, which are the main languages that I use today. I built a complete 
point-of-sale system in Pascal for my final project when I graduated high school.

I also learned **Linux** from books and CDs that I borrowed from the local library 
around 2001, and Iâ€™ve been using it as my main workstation ever since, but Iâ€™m also 
experienced in Windows and macOS.

I graduated from a technical high school in 2003 with an N3 in Electrical Engineering 
and an N3 in Logic Systems. I also studied N4: Industrial Electronics, 
N4: Communication Electronics, and N4: Logic Systems at college in 2005, so I have a 
rare combination of software and hardware knowledge.
